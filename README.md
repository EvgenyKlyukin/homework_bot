## Tech Stack:
The project uses the following technologies and tools:  

- **Python**: The primary programming language.  
- **pyTelegramBotAPI**: Library for interacting with the Telegram API.  
- **requests**: To interact with the Yandex API.  
- **logging**: Used for logging in the application.  
- **Pytest**: A framework for writing and running tests.  

## Installation
1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the dependencies by running the command:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Create a file .env in the root of the project and add the following environment variables to it:
```bash
    PRACTICUM_TOKEN
    TELEGRAM_TOKEN
    TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
```

## Logging
The bot uses logging to track its work. Each message in the log contains:

- Date and time of the event
- The level of importance of the event
- Event Description

## Exceptions
The project uses its own exceptions, which are stored in a file. exceptions.py . This allows you to more accurately handle errors that occur during the operation of the bot.

## Tests
The project uses tests written with the pytest framework. To run the tests, execute the following command:
```bash
   pytest
```
The test configuration is located in the 'pytest.ini` file. The tests check the correct functioning of the main components of the game
